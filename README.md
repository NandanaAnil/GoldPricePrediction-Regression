This project aims to predict the price of gold using regression techniques by analyzing historical data of various financial indicators. The dataset includes key economic features such as crude oil prices, stock indices (e.g., S&P 500), exchange rates, and interest rates, which are known to influence the value of gold.

The project follows a structured data science pipeline:

Data Exploration: Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting data for training and testing.

Model Development: Implementation of multiple regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Decision Tree Regressor.

Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score are used to evaluate model performance.

Visualization: Comparative plots and heatmaps are used to illustrate correlations and model predictions.

Outcome:
The project successfully identifies the best-performing model for predicting gold prices and provides insights into the most influential economic indicators. It demonstrates how machine learning can be used effectively in financial forecasting.
